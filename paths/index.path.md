## Course Topics and Schedule

You will be building an AI system of 5-6 modules, each engaging one or more topics from this course. Rather than completing pre-defined assignments, you will propose your own sequence of modules unified by an overarching theme.

Your modules must align with and when topics are covered in class. The goal is to begin work on a module after the relevant content has been taught, although small exceptions may arise.

| Time Spent (weeks)  | Topics Covered                                                                                                           |
