## Course Topics and Schedule

You will be building an AI system of 7 modules, each engaging one or more topics from this course. Rather than completing pre-defined assignments, you will propose your own sequence of modules unified by an overarching theme.

Your modules must align with and when topics are covered in class. The goal is to begin work on a module after the relevant content has been taught, although small exceptions may arise.

| Week  | Topics Covered                                                                                                           |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1–3   | Propositional Logic (Entailment, Knowledge Bases, Inference Methods, Chaining, CNF, Resolution, Soundness, Completeness) |
| 4–5   | Uninformed Search (BFS, DFS, Uniform Cost, Iterative Deepening), Informed Search (Heuristics, A*, IDA*, Beam Search)     |
| 5–6   | First-Order Logic (Quantifiers, Unification, Inference, Chaining)                                                        |
| 7–8   | Advanced Search (Optimization, Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithms)                                   |
| 9–10  | NLP Before LLMs (n-grams, Word Embeddings), Games and Game Theory (Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, MCTS, Nash Equilibrium)  |
| 11–12 | Reinforcement Learning (Policy, MDP, Value Functions, Q-Learning), Introduction to Supervised Learning                   |
| 13–15 | Evaluation Metrics, Class Imbalance, Convolutional Neural Networks, Graph Neural Networks                                |

## Module Due Dates and Checkpoints

| Module               | Due     | Checkpoint |
| -------------------- | ------- | ---------- |
| 1                    | Week 3  | ✓ Graded   |
| 2                    | Week 5  |            |
| 3                    | Week 6  | ✓ Graded   |

| 7                    | Week 14 | ✓ Graded   |
| Paper + Presentation | Finals  | ✓ Graded   |

Checkpoints are graded assessments. All modules completed since the previous checkpoint are evaluated together.
