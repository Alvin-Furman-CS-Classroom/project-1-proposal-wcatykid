## Recommendations

**Best overall:** Use [Cursor](./cursor.guide.md) with Claude Opus 4.5, or [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/) if you prefer working in the terminal. Claude Opus 4.5 is currently the most capable coding model available, and the $20/mo Claude Pro subscription works with both Cursor and Claude Code. This setup will give you the best results in this course.

**Free option:** If cost is a concern, start with [GitHub Copilot](./github-copilot.guide.md). It is [free for students](./github-copilot.guide.md#free-access-for-students) and works well for most tasks. You can also try [Cursor](./cursor.guide.md) with its [free student year](./cursor.guide.md#free-year-for-students) if you qualify.

**Budget paid option:** Windsurf Pro at $15/mo is the most affordable paid agent if you want something in between.

## A Note on Chat Apps

Tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini (web chat versions) are useful for explanations and brainstorming, but they are not coding agents. They do not have direct access to your codebase and cannot make changes to your files automatically. For this course, use an actual coding agent from the list above.
