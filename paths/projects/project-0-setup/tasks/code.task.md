# Task 1: Your First Program with an Agent

Create a simple Python program with help from your AI agent.

## The Goal

Build a **greeting program** that:

1. Asks for the user's name
2. Displays a personalized greeting

That's it! Keep it simple. You'll create this in the `task1/` folder in your repository.

---

## Step 1: Start the conversation

Open your repository in your editor with your agent active. Try saying:

> I want to create a simple Python program in task1/ that asks for my name and prints a greeting.

## Step 2: Watch and learn

As your agent responds, pay attention to:

- Does it explain what it's doing, or just write code?
- Does it ask clarifying questions?
- Does it create the file in the right place?

## Step 3: Run the code

Follow your agent's instructions to run the program. If something doesn't work, tell your agent what happened—copy/paste the error message.

```bash
python task1/greeting.py
```

## Step 4: Extend it (optional)

Once the basic version works, try asking your agent to add a feature:

- Add the current time to the greeting
- Make it greet differently based on time of day (morning/afternoon/evening)
- Add some ASCII art

---

## Tips

- **Be specific** — "Add the current time" is better than "make it fancier"
- **Share errors** — Copy/paste the full error message if something goes wrong
- **Ask questions** — If you don't understand something the agent wrote, ask!
