# Task 3: General Computing with an Agent

Use your AI agent to help with a **non-programming task**. This demonstrates that agents can assist with all kinds of computing work, not just writing code.

Save any artifacts you create in `task3/`.

---

## Pick One Option

Choose one of these (or make up your own):

### Option A: Organize Files

> I have a bunch of screenshots on my desktop with names like "Screenshot 2024-01-15 at 10.32.45 AM.png". Can you help me come up with a system to rename and organize them? Create a script in task3/ if you want.

Ask your agent to:
- Suggest a naming convention
- Write a script to rename files (optional)
- Recommend a folder structure

### Option B: Summarize Something

> I need to understand [topic] for a class. Can you give me a quick summary and point me to good resources? Save a summary in task3/notes.md

Pick any topic you're curious about. See how the agent:
- Structures information
- Handles follow-up questions
- Suggests resources

### Option C: Debug a Problem

> My computer is running slowly / my WiFi keeps dropping / [any tech issue you have]. Can you help me troubleshoot?

Walk through a real (or hypothetical) tech problem. Notice how the agent:
- Asks diagnostic questions
- Suggests steps to try
- Explains what it's checking

Save a log of what you tried in `task3/troubleshooting.md`.

### Option D: Your Choice

Think of any computing-related task you'd normally do manually or Google for help with. Try asking your agent instead. Save whatever you create in `task3/`.

## Reflection Questions

- Was the agent helpful for this type of task?
- How did it compare to Googling for help?
- What types of non-coding tasks might you use an agent for in the future?

---

## Tips

- **Be detailed** — Give context about your specific situation
- **Follow along** — If the agent suggests steps, try them and report back
- **Ask why** — Understanding the reasoning helps you learn
