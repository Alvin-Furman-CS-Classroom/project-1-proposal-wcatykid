# Task 2: Planning with an Agent

Use your AI agent as a **thinking partner** to plan something. This task shows that agents aren't just for writing code—they can help you brainstorm, organize ideas, and think through problems.

## The Scenario

You're organizing a **study group** for an upcoming exam. You need to:

- Figure out what topics to cover
- Decide how to structure the sessions
- Create some kind of plan or schedule

You don't have to actually run this study group—just create a reasonable plan and save it in `task2/`.

## Step 1: Set up the scenario

Tell your agent about the situation:

> I need to organize a study group for my algorithms midterm. There are 4 of us, and we have 2 weeks until the exam. Can you help me plan this? Save the plan in task2/study-plan.md

## Step 2: Brainstorm together

Let the agent help you think through:

- What topics should you cover?
- How should you divide up the work?
- What format works best (lectures, practice problems, discussion)?

Notice how the agent asks questions, makes suggestions, and helps structure your thinking.

## Step 3: Create an artifact

Ask the agent to help you create something concrete in `task2/`:

- A schedule or timeline
- A checklist of topics
- A shared document outline

---

## Reflection Questions

As you work through this, think about:

- Did the agent ask good clarifying questions?
- Did it feel like a conversation or like getting a pre-written answer?
- Would you actually use an agent to plan something like this?

## Tips

- **Think out loud** — Share your constraints and preferences ("We can only meet on weekends")
- **Push back** — If a suggestion doesn't work, say so and explain why
- **Iterate** — Ask for revisions or alternatives
