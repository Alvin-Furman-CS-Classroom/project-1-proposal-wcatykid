This folder contains Claude Code skills for automated feedback on your proposal.

## Available Skills

### proposal-review

Self-review your proposal against the CSC-343 Proposal Rubric. Get scores and actionable feedback on all 8 criteria before instructor review.

**Usage:**
```
Review my proposal
```

This will analyze your README.md and provide:
- Estimated scores per criterion
- Constraint checklist (word counts, required elements)
- Specific areas for improvement
- Quick wins to boost your score

## When to Use

Run the proposal review:
- After completing your first draft
- Before the Monday deadline (draft)
- Before the Thursday deadline (final)
- Anytime you want to self-assess

## Note

The review is automated guidance, not official grading. Use it to catch issues early, but the instructor's evaluation is final.
