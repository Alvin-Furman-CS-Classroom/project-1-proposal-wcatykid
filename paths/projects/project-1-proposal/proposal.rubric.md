# Proposal Rubric

This rubric is used to assess the project proposal submitted at the beginning of Week 2 (draft) and Thursday of Week 2 (final).

## Point Scale

| Score | Description                                                                        |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 4     | **Exceeds expectations.** Professional quality. No meaningful improvements needed. |
| 3     | **Meets expectations.** Solid work with minor issues.                              |
| 2     | **Partially meets expectations.** Acceptable but with notable weaknesses.          |
| 1     | **Below expectations.** Significant problems, but evidence of effort.              |
| 0     | **Missing or fundamentally inadequate.**                                           |

## Expectations

LLM assistance is permitted and expected for proposal generation. Therefore, standards are high. A well-prompted LLM should produce excellent proposals; your job is to prompt effectively, review critically, and refine the output.

**Concision is valued.** Verbose, bloated, or padded proposals will be penalized. Say what needs to be said clearly and stop.

## Criteria

### 1. Coherence of Theme

Does the overarching theme unify the 7 modules into a coherent system?

| Score | Description                                                                                                                                    |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 4     | Theme is compelling, original, and naturally connects all modules. The system tells a clear story. Each module's role in the whole is obvious. |
| 3     | Theme is clear and connects modules well. Minor stretches in how some modules fit.                                                             |
| 2     | Theme exists but feels forced. Some modules seem disconnected from the overarching concept.                                                    |
| 1     | Theme is weak or arbitrary. Modules feel like separate assignments with a superficial label.                                                   |
| 0     | No coherent theme. Modules are unrelated.                                                                                                      |

### 2. Feasibility and Course Synchronization

Is the proposal achievable within the course timeline? Do module prerequisites align with when content is taught?

| Score | Description                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 4     | Feasibility study is complete and accurate. All modules are scheduled after their prerequisite content is covered. Scope is realistic for a pair of students within each time window. |
| 3     | Feasibility is mostly sound. Minor timing concerns or slightly ambitious scope for one or two modules.                                                                                |
| 2     | Feasibility issues present. Some modules scheduled before content is covered, or scope is questionable for multiple modules.                                                          |
| 1     | Significant feasibility problems. Multiple synchronization errors or unrealistic scope throughout.                                                                                    |
| 0     | No feasibility study, or proposal is clearly impossible.                                                                                                                              |

### 3. Scope Appropriateness

Is each module appropriately scoped—neither too ambitious nor too trivial?

| Score | Description                                                                                                                            |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 4     | All modules are well-scoped. Each represents meaningful work achievable in the allotted time. None are padding; none are overwhelming. |
| 3     | Scope is generally appropriate. One or two modules may be slightly over- or under-scoped.                                              |
| 2     | Scope issues present. Several modules feel too trivial or too ambitious.                                                               |
| 1     | Scope is poorly judged throughout. Most modules are either padding or unrealistic.                                                     |
| 0     | Scope is not addressed or is completely unreasonable.                                                                                  |

### 4. Clarity and Concision

Is the proposal clear, precise, and free of unnecessary verbosity?

| Score | Description                                                                                                                            |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 4     | Proposal is crisp and precise. Every sentence earns its place. Module descriptions are clear and under 250 words. No filler, no fluff. |
| 3     | Proposal is clear with minor verbosity. Mostly concise; occasional unnecessary elaboration.                                            |
| 2     | Proposal is understandable but padded. Verbose sections, repetitive phrasing, or filler content.                                       |
| 1     | Proposal is difficult to parse. Bloated, unclear, or reads like unedited LLM output.                                                   |
| 0     | Proposal is incoherent or unreadable.                                                                                                  |

### 5. I/O Specification Quality

Are inputs and outputs clearly specified for each module?

| Score | Description                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 4     | Each module has crystal-clear input and output specifications. A reader knows exactly what goes in and what comes out. Specifications are concrete and testable. |
| 3     | I/O specifications are clear for most modules. Minor ambiguity in one or two.                                                                                    |
| 2     | I/O specifications present but vague or incomplete for several modules.                                                                                          |
| 1     | I/O specifications are unclear throughout. Reader cannot determine what modules actually do.                                                                     |
| 0     | No I/O specifications provided.                                                                                                                                  |

### 6. System Integration

Do module descriptions explain how each module fits into the larger system?

| Score | Description                                                                                                                                     |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 4     | Integration is clearly articulated for all modules. Data flow between modules is obvious. The system architecture is evident from the proposal. |
| 3     | Integration is explained for most modules. Minor gaps in how pieces connect.                                                                    |
| 2     | Integration is mentioned but unclear. Reader must infer how modules relate.                                                                     |
| 1     | Little attention to integration. Modules described in isolation.                                                                                |
| 0     | No integration described. Modules appear unconnected.                                                                                           |

### 7. Coverage Rationale

Is there a clear justification for the choice of topics covered?

| Score | Description                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 4     | Rationale is thoughtful and compelling. Topic choices align naturally with the theme and demonstrate intentional selection. Trade-offs acknowledged if relevant. |
| 3     | Rationale is provided and reasonable. Minor gaps in justification.                                                                                               |
| 2     | Rationale is superficial. Topics seem arbitrarily chosen; justification is weak.                                                                                 |
| 1     | Rationale is missing or unconvincing. No clear reason for topic selection.                                                                                       |
| 0     | No rationale provided.                                                                                                                                           |

### 8. Module Description Quality

Are individual module descriptions complete and well-crafted?

| Score | Description                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 4     | All 8 module descriptions are excellent. Each includes title, topics, I/O, integration context, and prerequisites. Descriptions are specific and informative. |
| 3     | Module descriptions are good. All required elements present with minor weaknesses.                                                                            |
| 2     | Module descriptions are uneven. Some are complete; others lack required elements or are vague.                                                                |
| 1     | Module descriptions are poor. Most lack required elements or are too vague to evaluate.                                                                       |
| 0     | Module descriptions are missing or unusable.                                                                                                                  |
