# Project 1: Proposal Notes

One of these two _MUST_ be covered in the proposal.

- Make sure that "logic and reasoning" from the first set of topics (not first-order logic) is covered in the proposal.
- Next is "searching" (Uniform Cost, Iterative Deepening, Heuristics, A*, IDA*, Beam Search, use of BFS or DFS must be non-trivial)

Only some proposals get picked based on the groups and interests.

## AGENTS.md

- Instructions for proposal guidance
- Reinforce the ordering constraints of topics and coverage (see [Course Topics and Schedule](../../resources/343-topics-and-schedule.guide.md))

## Agent Skill
