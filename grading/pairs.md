# Student Project Pairs

Based on proposal topic similarity analysis, the following pairs are recommended for semester-long collaboration:

## Pair 1: Trading & Finance Systems
- **CollinRiddle** - Intelligent Trading Agent (Strategy Discovery Through Search and Adaptive Risk Management)
- **RickKing07** - AI-Powered Emotion-Based Trading Assistant (Sentiment-Based Trading)

**Rationale:** Both systems focus on financial trading with complementary approaches. CollinRiddle's system discovers trading strategies through search and optimization, while RickKing07's system uses sentiment analysis and emotion-based decision making. They share common ground in risk management, decision validation, and trading signal generation, making collaboration natural.

## Pair 2: Food & Health Systems
- **ElliottChmil** - Recipe AI System (Recipe Discovery, Adaptation, and Generation)
- **Linji9** - Adaptive Diabetic Diet Advisor (Meal Safety and Blood Sugar Management)

**Rationale:** Both systems work with food, nutrition, and dietary constraints. ElliottChmil's system handles recipe discovery and adaptation, while Linji9's system focuses on meal safety and blood sugar management. They share knowledge representation needs (nutritional data, dietary constraints), search algorithms (finding compatible meals/recipes), and constraint satisfaction (dietary compatibility). Natural integration potential.

## Pair 3: Game Theory & Strategic Analysis
- **cptareb** - Chickenizer (Chicken Game Strategy Analysis)
- **wrigvi3** - Heads-Up Pre-Flop Poker Strategy Analyzer

**Rationale:** Both systems analyze strategic games using game theory. cptareb focuses on the Chicken game with Nash equilibrium analysis, while wrigvi3 analyzes poker pre-flop strategies. They share propositional logic for rule encoding, search for optimal strategies, game theory (Nash equilibrium, minimax), and reinforcement learning for adaptation. Strong thematic alignment.

## Pair 4: Text Processing & Knowledge Systems
- **Cereal-Seagull** - Rule-Based Text Corpus Creator/Explorer with Relational Search
- **eleanorbadgett** - Intelligent PDF Table Parser and Basic Agent

**Rationale:** Both systems process and analyze text/documents with knowledge representation. Cereal-Seagull builds text corpora with morphological and semantic analysis, while eleanorbadgett parses PDF tables and enables question-answering. They share NLP techniques (word embeddings, text analysis), knowledge representation, search algorithms (for information retrieval), and first-order logic for reasoning. Complementary document processing approaches.

---

## Pair 5: Scheduling & Optimization Systems
- **davent4** - Musical Theater Rehearsal Scheduler
- **CaseRiddle056** - Industrial Equipment Monitoring & Predictive Maintenance System

**Rationale:** Both systems involve optimization, scheduling, and constraint satisfaction. davent4 schedules rehearsals with complex constraints, while CaseRiddle056 optimizes maintenance schedules. They share search algorithms (A*, optimization), propositional/first-order logic for constraints, and planning/optimization techniques. Different domains but similar problem-solving approaches.

---

## Pair 6: Logic & Reasoning Systems
- **t-masvimbo** - Logic Puzzle Generation and Analysis System
- **brodeeC** - Atmospheric Conditions Advisor

**Rationale:** Both systems use logical reasoning and knowledge representation extensively. t-masvimbo generates and solves logic puzzles using propositional logic, while brodeeC uses logic for weather-based decision making. They share propositional logic, first-order logic, knowledge bases, and inference methods. Strong logical reasoning alignment.

## Pair 7: Adaptive Systems with Learning
- **SeanRowland7** - AI Personal Training System for Beginners
- **alvaad4** - The Colony Manager: AI-Adversarial Survival System

**Rationale:** Both systems involve adaptive learning, optimization, and strategic decision-making. SeanRowland7 adapts training programs using RL and game theory, while alvaad4 manages resources and uses adversarial AI with game theory. They share reinforcement learning, game theory concepts (Nash equilibrium, minimax), search algorithms, and adaptive decision-making. Different domains but similar learning/adaptation patterns.

---

## Pair 8: Pattern Recognition & Ambiguity Resolution (Solo Option)
- **kcbailey111** - Handwritten Music Recognition System

**Note:** With 15 completed proposals, we have 7 pairs (14 students) and 1 student with a unique domain. **kcbailey111**'s Handwritten Music Recognition System involves pattern recognition and ambiguity resolution using search and logic, which is sufficiently distinct that solo work may be most appropriate. Alternatively, kcbailey111 could form a group of 3 with an existing pair if collaborative benefits are identified, or could potentially collaborate with another pattern recognition project if re-pairing is desired.

## Notes on Pairing Strategy

- **Primary consideration:** Similarity in AI techniques and problem-solving approaches
- **Secondary consideration:** Domain similarity (food, games, finance, etc.)
- **Tertiary consideration:** Complementary strengths (one strong in search, one strong in logic, etc.)

Some students have unique domains but share similar AI techniques, making collaboration valuable even across different application areas. The pairs above balance domain similarity with technical approach alignment.
