# Proposal Feedback: wcatykid

## Overall Assessment
**Status:** ✗ INCOMPLETE - Still contains template placeholder text

## Critical Issue
Proposal is still in template form with `[Your System Title]` and placeholder module descriptions (`[Title]`, `_Course topic(s) covered_`, etc.). No actual system content has been added.

## Action Required
**Submit actual proposal content.** The template repository README.md does not contain a filled-in proposal. Please provide:
1. System title and overview
2. Module descriptions with real topics and specifications
3. Feasibility study with course timeline
4. Coverage rationale

Refer to [Project 1 template](../project-1-proposal/project-proposal-repository/README.md) for expected format, but fill in your own system description, not placeholders.
