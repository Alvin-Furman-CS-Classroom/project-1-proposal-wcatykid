# Goals

This is a scaffold repository for the CSC-343: AI course at Furman University.

## Key References

- [AI System Student Proposal Project](./paths/proposal.project.md)
- [Proposal Rubric](./paths/proposal.rubric.md)
- [Module Rubric](materials/module_rubric.md)
- [Code Elegance Rubric](materials/code_elegance_rubric.md)

There are also powerpoint slides with the bulk of the instruction in them.

## Curriculum authoring

The curriculum should be authored in markdown files using "PathMX" conventions.

PathMX conventions are as follows:

- Files are plain markdown with optional frontmatter for additional metadata.
- Files are "type-hinted" to indicate their purpose in the curriculum.
  - Example type-hinted files:
    - `propositional-logic.lecture.md` is a lecture file. It's not the literal powerpoint presentation but its more like the conceptual "spine" of the lecture that we can produce in multiple instructional forms (tutorials, guides, print-outs, slides, etc.)
    - `project-proposal.project.md` is a project proposal file. It's a markdown file that contains the proposal for the project written a student/group of students.
    - `project-proposal.rubric.md` is a rubric file. It's a markdown file that contains the rubric for the project proposal and is used by human and/or AI agents to evaluate the project proposal.
- Files are linked together via normal links. These links create a knowledge graph that then can be followed by students using the PathMX player UI.

### Structure

```bash
csc-343/
├── .claude/ # Claude skills/plugins etc for Claude Code (also work in Cursor)
├── admin/ # TA, Professor, etc. administrative tasks and scripts
├── paths/
│   ├── index.path.md # The root path that links everything together for students
│   ├── lectures/ # lecture markdown files with core concepts/materials from course lectures
│   ├── proposal.project.md # The student/group builds a project proposal for the entire course
│   ├── proposal.rubric.md # The rubric for the project proposal

```

### Github Classroom

Students will use Github Classroom to build and submit their projects. They may also recieve feedback on their projects from the instructor and/or AI agents via Github Pull Requests.

Each project will have a template repository that will be used by github classroom to create the project repository for the student. Template repositories are pushed via git subtrees to avoid cluttering the main repository with template code.

## Rubrics

Rubrics are used by the instructor and/or AI agents to evaluate the student's work.

- [Module Rubric](./paths/module.rubric.md)
- [Code Elegance Rubric](./paths/code-elegance.rubric.md)
- [Proposal Rubric](./paths/proposal.rubric.md)

## Claude Code/Skills

This repo comes with various Claude Code/Skills/Plugins/etc. that are used to help with the administrative tasks of the course.

### Planning/Tasks

- [ ] Figure out group project setup in classroom
- [x] Claude skills/scripts for github classroom management tasks (see `.claude/skills/github-classroom/`)

### Web Deployment

The PathMX files are deployed to `csc-343.path.app` using the PathMX CLI.
