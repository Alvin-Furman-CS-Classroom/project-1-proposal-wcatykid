# Goals

This is a scaffold repository for the CSC-343: AI course at Furman University.

## Curriculum authoring

The curriculum should be authored in markdown files using "PathMX" conventions.

PathMX conventions are as follows:

- Files are plain markdown with optional frontmatter for additional metadata.
- Files are "type-hinted" to indicate their purpose in the curriculum.
  - Example type-hinted files:
    - `project-proposal.project.md` is a project proposal file. It's a markdown file that contains the proposal written by the student.
    - `project-proposal.rubric.md` is a rubric file. It's a markdown file that contains the rubric for the project proposal and is used by human and/or AI agents to evaluate the project proposal.
- Files are linked together via normal links. These links create a knowledge graph that then can be followed by students using the PathMX player UI.

├── admin/ # TA, Professor, etc. administrative tasks and scripts
├── paths/
│   ├── index.path.md # The root path that links everything together for students
│   ├── projects/ # project markdown files with core concepts/materials from course projects
│     ├── project-1 # propoal project (individual assignment)
│         ├── proposal.project.md  # project guide (deployed to students via PathMX)
│         ├── proposal.rubric.md  # project rubric (used by evaluators)
│         ├── proposal-repository  # Github Classroom template repository
│     ├── project-2 # ai system project (group assignment) follows same structure as project-1
│   ├── labs/ # lab exercises, guides, instructions, etc.
│   ├── resources/ # general reference materials, links, etc.
```

### Github Classroom

Students will use Github Classroom to build and submit their projects. They may also recieve feedback on their projects from the instructor and/or AI agents via Github Pull Requests.

Each project will have a template repository that will be used by github classroom to create the project repository for the student. Template repositories are pushed via git subtrees to avoid cluttering the main repository with template code.

## Rubrics

Rubrics are used by the instructor and/or AI agents to evaluate the student's work.

- [Project 1:Proposal Rubric](./paths/proposal.rubric.md)
- [Project 2: AI System Rubric](./paths/ai-system.rubric.md)
- [General Code Elegance Rubric](./paths/code-elegance.rubric.md)

## Claude Code/Skills

This repo comes with various Claude Code/Skills/Plugins/etc. that are used to help with the administrative tasks of the course.

### Web Deployment (PathMX Player)

The PathMX files are deployed to the PathMX Player at [csc-343.path.app](https://csc-343.path.app) using the PathMX CLI (WIP). Mark will try to get this setup so that it will automatically deploy when changes are pushed to the main branch but in the meantime, let Mark know if you need to deploy changes.
